ESTIMATION OF URBAN AIR QUALITY USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNINIG 
#ABSTRACT
To propose a machine learning-based method to accurately predict the Air Quality Index value 
by prediction results in the form of best accuracy from comparing supervised classification 
machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random 
Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Na√Øve Bayes, and Decision Tree. Additionally, to compare and 
discuss the performance of various machine learning algorithms from the given transport traffic 
department dataset with an evaluation of GUI-based user interface air quality prediction by 
attributes. Analysis of major air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O3, and NH3.
